# DukeCarge's attempt at Advent of Code 2023
Welcome to my 4th attempt to learn Rust while on vacation. Every folder in this project should be able to be built and run standalone aside from the `utils` lib that is included (Yeah I know, there is a cargo crate called that but ech).

Note: I always reach for the struct. It's like a drug for me and I always hit everything with a struct.
